# 🪟 Windows Setup

WSL? (TODO) 🔧

## 🔄 Alternative Setup Methods

If native Windows installation doesn't work for you, try these platform-independent alternatives:

- 🐳 [Docker](docker.md) - Run ROS2 in a containerized environment
- 💻 [VirtualBox](virtualbox.md) - Set up Ubuntu 24.04 in a VM (easiest option!)
- 📦 [Vagrant](vagrant.md) - Automated VM setup with configuration options
- 🌐 [Remote Setup](remote.md) - Connect to lab computers remotely

💡 **Note**: These alternative methods should work fine for individual labs and signoffs.
However, if you need to communicate with physical TurtleBots in the lab, you may need additional networking configuration.

## ✅ Post-Installation

After installing `ros2`, see:
