# 🍎 macOS Setup

📦 There are no pre-built binaries for macOS.
So you would need to [build it from source](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Alternatives/macOS-Development-Setup.html). 🔨

💡 If you don't feel comfortable disabling `System Integrity Protection` (SIP), [remote setup](remote.md) could be an alternative.

✅ After installing `ros2`, see:
- 🔧 [Handy commands to run after ROS2 installation](../../post-ros2-install.md)
- 🛠️ [Handy ROS2 commands for debugging](../../handy-ros2-commands.md)
