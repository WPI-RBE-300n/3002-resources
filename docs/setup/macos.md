# macOS Setup

There are no pre-built binaries for macOS.
So you would need to [build it from source](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Installation/Alternatives/macOS-Development-Setup.html).

If you don't feel comfortable disabling `System Integrity Protection` (SIP), [remote setup](./remote.md) could be an alternative.

After installing `ros2`, see:
- [Handy commands to run after ROS2 installation](../post-ros2-install.md)
- [Handy ROS2 commands for debugging](../handy-ros2-commands.md)
